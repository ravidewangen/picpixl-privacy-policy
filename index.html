  <h2>Images and Media</h2>

  <p>
    PicPixl provides a collection of ready-made marketing and greeting images that are

    Users may optionally select a personal photo from their device gallery to include
    in designs for marketing or greeting use.
  </p>

  <p>
    Personal photos selected by users remain on the local device and are processed only
